import { ContentEditable } from '@site/../../components/react-contenteditable/src';
import { useState, useRef } from 'react'

# Performance considerations

By default, the component does not use state internally to keep track of text changes. It uses react's `useRef` hook to reduce rerenders.
However, the initial example used `useState` which causes rerender of the parent and so all children components. This was only shown
for simplicity but should be avoided if possible to reduce render times (especially for big block posts). The following example will
show the rerendering problem with `useState` and a simple solution to improve the performance.

export const RerenderDemoState = () => {
  const renders = useRef(0);
  const [content, setContent] = useState("Edit me!");
  renders.current += 1;
  return (
    <div>
      <ContentEditable html={content} onChange={setContent} />
      Component rerenders: <strong>{renders.current}</strong>
    </div>
  );
}

<RerenderDemoState /><br />

Here you can see, that the parent element get's rerendered every time the user types into the editable field. To be fair, 99% of the times
this won't cause any problems because react is really performant. But why shoot sparrows with cannons if there is an better option.

```tsx
import { ContentEditable } from '@infotition/react-contenteditable';
import { useRef, FunctionComponent } from 'react';

type EditorProps = { initialContent: string; }

const Editor: FunctionComponent<EditorProps> = ({initialContent}) => {
  const content = useRef(initialContent);

  const handleChange = (val: string) => {
    content.current = val;
  }

  return <ContentEditable html={content.current} onChange={handleChange} />;
}

export default Editor;
```

This example uses `useRef` to keep track of the changes. This causes to rerenderings. If you want to get the current value, you can access it with `content.current`.

export const RerenderDemoRef = () => {
  const renders = useRef(0);
  const content = useRef("Edit me!");
  renders.current += 1;
    const handleChange = (val) => {
    content.current = val;
  }
  return (
    <div>
      <ContentEditable html={content.current} onChange={handleChange} />
      Component rerenders: <strong>{renders.current}</strong>
    </div>
  );
}

<RerenderDemoRef /><br />

As you can see, the component doesn't get rerenders after it was mounted... and this without even using stuff like `useMemo`.
