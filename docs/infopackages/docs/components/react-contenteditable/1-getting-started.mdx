import { ContentEditable } from '@site/../../components/react-contenteditable/src';

# Getting started

React component representing an custom element with editable contents.

## Quick started

The `ContentEditable` component takes various props to render a custom component with editable content.
It is written for modern react using react hooks. But why should you need something like this? Maybe you want
to create a rich text editor with headings, bold text and stuff like this. This component renders the html string
inline as real html, so you can embed everything in this element.

<ContentEditable html="<h3>Quick Demo (Edit me)</h3>To see this component in action as quickly as possible, you can try it out here and look at its source code." /> <br />

```tsx
import { ContentEditable } from '@infotition/react-contenteditable';
import { useState, FunctionComponent } from 'react';

type EditorProps = { initialContent: string; }

const Editor: FunctionComponent<EditorProps> = ({initialContent}) => {
  const [content, setContent] = useState(initialContent);
  return <ContentEditable html={content} onChange={setContent} />;
}

export default Editor;
```

## Installation

```bash
npm install @infotition/react-contenteditable
```

Or:

```bash
yarn add @infotition/react-contenteditable
```

If you want the default styling to be enabled, you must import the css file first.

## Features

The following features define this implementation:
- 100 % type safe, well tested and documented component via Typescript.
- Full ECMAScript module support.
- Implemented to use in functional component with react hook api.
- Less than 600B bundle size with zero dependencies (headless available).
- Various props to interact with the component.
- Simple default styling of the editable div.
