import { createSplashAnimation } from '@site/../../packages/create-splash-animation/src';

# Getting started

An utility package for to play material design splash animations on click events.

## Quick start

This package provides a function to create a ripple/splash animation after click animation. It creates an absolute span element as child at the
clicked position and adds the provided class name to it. The class then needs to play the animation (e.g. scaling the size of the element).
You can look at the following example in react on how to use the package properly.

<div
  className="ripple-container"
  onClick={(e) => createSplashAnimation(e, 'btn-ripple')}
/><br/>

```tsx
const Demo: FunctionComponent = () => {
  const handleClick = (event: MouseEvent) => {
    createSplashAnimation(event, 'splash');
  };

  return (
    <div className="container" onClick={handleClick} />
  );
}
```

```scss
.container {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: #9b7def;
  border-radius: 30px;
  overflow: hidden;
  position: relative;
}

.splash {
  animation: ripple 500ms ease;
  background-color: white;
}

@keyframes ripple {
  to { transform: scale(4); opacity: 0; }
}
```

For the animation to work, it is needed to set the container (the clickable element) to `relative` position and its overflow to `hidden`.
